# ALGORITHM: this program takes three arguments from the user (hours, minutes, seconds) then increments the
# seconds by 1 every time a real world second passed. The time function allows that to happen. 
# Clock, the class, does the addition by its 'tick' function, then increases hours and
# minutes accordingingly.
# the __str__ checks what kind of clock type it is (24 hours or 12 hours), then modifies the output 

import time
from Clock import * 

__name___ = "__main__"

hrs = int(input("What's the current hours? ==>"))
mins = int(input("What's the current minute? ==>"))
secs = int(input("What's the current second? ==>"))
  
clock = Clock(hrs, mins, secs, 1)

while True:
  print(clock)
  clock.tick()
  time.sleep(1)
  
 # special error handing: on this assignment i added a display_time + display hours for the 12 hour clock function,
 # display_time is a temporary variable that allows me to subtract 12 in order to keep the output correct,
 # but allows hours to stay consistent & to be incremented normally, the display_time is what determines 'am' or 
 # 'pm' and is based off of hours being within a certain interval. there are two other 'else' statements that just
 # ensure the right time is being displayed (ie 12 am instead of 0:00 am)
